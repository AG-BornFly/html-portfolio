<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>This is my very first webpage and am kind of shocked that I was able to create one.
  I've never liked to code...like ever, I have a background in Service, technical support and Electrical engineering technology. 
  The only programming I was ever exposed to was in college and the language was C++, boy did I struggle in that.
  I didnt really give it a chance and right off the bat thought it was a weird form of knowledge that was meant for "geeks". 
  The fact that I can now do some web dev and code is really intriging and am lowkey kind of geeked for it, its funny how life works right?
</p>

<p>You're probably thinking so what got this guy into web dev and coding anyway? Funny and long story but I'll keep it short and sweet.
   One of my good friends that has been running a startup Digital marketing Agency offered me a position in his company. 
   I at the time was a service technician and was losing love for my job, you can say it was a perfect time for a new opportunity. 
   I was up for the challenge and was given a few months to transition, it was a jam packed 3 months to be honest. 
   I am now in the final phase and learning front and back end development, the first 2 months consisted of learning
   the Digital marketing techniques and how the business works.

<p> As you can see, I now know how to make a webpage "insert dancing emoji", okay maybe thats not how it works but I will get a dancing emoji in..on a different page. 
  I've always been a person thats open to new things and I thankful I gave coding a second chance, the funny thing is I didnt do all that bad in my college coding program. 
  I passed with a 77%, I just felt like I didnt really grasp the true meaning of coding and I also had other views of it at that point in time. 
  If I ran into my college self he would probably call me a geek and I would be okay with that because this geek is getting paid.
